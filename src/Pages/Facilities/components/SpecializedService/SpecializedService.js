                        <div className="para">Aeromodelling is the art of designing, building and flying miniature aircraft models — powered or non-powered. Aeromodelling is not as daunting as it looks. In fact, if followed on the right lines, it can be extremely thrilling.
                            It is exciting that we can make airplane models with our own hands, which will also make understandings of aerodynamics. For those who dream to becoming pilots and aircraft engineers Aeromodelling helps them greatly, as it guides them with basic fundamentals of aerodynamics and physics.
                            The objective of FLYAFC is to create world -class Aeromodellers to participate in National & International competition.</div>

                            Take the ride with your family or go on a romantic swing in the skies with your partner. Or to explore some adventure and thrill. Whichever way it is, it will etch your memory with beautiful moments spent in the sky. You will truly get the feel of flying, which can be experienced in a small aircraft, unlike a passenger airline in which one cannot really get the feel of flying.
                            So, go on, glide in the air and experience some real flying!</div>
